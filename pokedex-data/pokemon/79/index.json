	"description": "Slowpoke are known to be paitient anglers with their tail. However, sometimes they forget they're even fishing at all, on account of finding it hard to register pain. A slowpoke's tail can be removed in times of extreme duress and it will grow back in a few weeks. The tails are a delicacy in a few places.",
	"notes": "lavenderSiren and powerKitten both have a slowpoke, kantonian and galar formes, repectively. They are very nice to cuddle with, as long as they aren't hungry.",
